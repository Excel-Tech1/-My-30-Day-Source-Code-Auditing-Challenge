#  A Source Code Auditing Challenge


# ðŸ”Ž My 30-Day Source Code Auditing Challenge

A hands-on deep dive into code, security, and the mindset of an auditor.

Over the next 30 days, Iâ€™m challenging myself to step deeper into the world of source code auditing â€” not just to learn how insecure code looks, but to understand why itâ€™s insecure, how vulnerabilities slip past developers, and how attackers exploit them.

ðŸ§  Why this challenge?

As a Junior Cybersecurity Analyst exploring SOC, DFIR, and malware analysis, I realized that code is often where it all begins. Whether itâ€™s a misconfigured smart contract, a vulnerable web app, or a careless input validation flaw, insecure code can open the doors to devastating attacks. This challenge is my way of leveling up â€” one day at a time.

ðŸ“… What to expect:

  Daily posts or recaps of real-world code audits, CTF-style challenges, open-source codebase reviews, and intentionally vulnerable apps.

  Tools Iâ€™ll use: semgrep, bandit, VS Code browser dev tools, and manual techniques.

  Topics covered: Input validation, authentication flaws, insecure cryptography, logic bugs, hardcoded secrets, and smart contract vulnerabilities.

  Writeups on what I find, what I miss, and what I learn â€” every step of the way.

ðŸš€ Whoâ€™s it for?

Whether you're:

  A beginner curious about cybersecurity and secure coding

  A developer wanting to write safer code

  Or a fellow security analyst brushing up your static analysis game
    â€”youâ€™ll find actionable insights, tools, and lessons here.

ðŸ’¬ Letâ€™s Learn Together

I'll be sharing each post right here on Hashnode. Feel free to follow, comment, ask questions, or even join the challenge. Iâ€™m documenting the journey not to show off what I know, but to track what Iâ€™m learning â€” raw, real, and in-progress.

Letâ€™s look at the code â€” and make it safer, one audit at a time.
